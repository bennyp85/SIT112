In this practical, you need to download all the materials to a folder (for example, week4) and start jupyter notebook from there.

1. Start your terminals / command prompts

2. Start your notebook and do exercises:
	- Type “jupyter notebook” to start the server.
	- Open 2-prac4.ipynb.
	- Read and run all code cells to see the output.
	- Fill your code in the code cell below each exercise.

3. What will you learn:
	- numpy package
	- matplotlib package
	- an understanding of the availability of data sources: rss feed, public data domain
	- be able to: load .xls, .csv and .json and export them into different data format
	- plot a histogram and a boxplot

4. What should you do in this practical?
	- Read and run through all code cells to see the outputs.
	- As this practical does not have any exercise, you should enter your own code to get yourself familiar with numpy, matplotlib and file I/O.
	- In the section 3, you will learn how to load files in different formats. You should open and have a look at the input files in the folder ./data/
