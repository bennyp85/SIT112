It is based on the IPython shell, but provides a cell-based web page environment with great interactivity, where calculations can be organized and documented in a structured way. In this note we will demonstrate how to load (read) a notebook, execute, and create one. \n",

    "Before ``IPython 3.0`` (released on 28 Feb 2015) ``IPython Notebook`` was a part of ``IPython`` project. Since many of its components are language-agnostic and can be used with other languages, after this release they have been moved to another project called ``Jupyter`` for better development. Jupyter Notebooks can be used along with languages such as ``Julia``, `'Python'`, ``R``, ``Ruby``, `'Matlab'`, `'Octave'`, and many other. \n",
