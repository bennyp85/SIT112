In this practical, you need to download 2-prac3.ipynb to a folder (for example, week3) and start jupyter notebook from there.

1. Start your terminals / command prompts (ignore if you know already):

	For those who use Mac, you can go through following steps to start your terminal if you prefer:
	- Head into System Preferences (click on the Apple icon on the top left of the screen) and select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services.
	- Find “New Terminal at Folder” in your right hand side and click the box.
	(If you already did the 2 steps above on your own machine, you don’t need to do them again)
	- Go to the directory of your folder, which contains prac3.ipynb, right-click on the folder and select “New Terminal at Folder” at the bottom.

	For those who use Windows machine, you just need to go to your folder, click on the address bar, type cmd and Enter.

2. Start your notebook and do exercises:
	- Type “jupyter notebook” to start the server.
	- Open 2-prac3.ipynb.
	- Read and run all code cells to see the output.
	- Fill your code in the code cell below each exercise.

3. What will you learn:
	- Different data formats, in particular: .csv, .xls, .xlxs, .json and .xml
	- Some basic input/output operations.
	- How to load a specific package in python using ‘import’ statement. Packages in python will help you to do various tasks just by calling their functions or methods. These functions are similar to Python build-in functions such as sum, min or max.
